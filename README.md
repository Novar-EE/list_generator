FIXME: When I changed the value of spinBox in tableWidget, the currentRow of tableWidget does not change. Now I reload the whole tableWidget when the value of spinBox is updated. This is not the best slution. Is there a way to change the currentRow of tableWidget when the sipnBox's value is changed.
